                For my first Mini Photo Challenge, I decided to choose the theme "pun," literally showing a pun in action.
                I decided to photograph the puns "we don't see eye to eye," "I can't focus," and "a drop in the bucket."
                For the first pun, I took a photo of myself looking at and away from a mirror, then cropped them together in Photoshop for the final edit.
                For the second pun, I intentionally took off my lens to get an extreme close-up and low focus effect.
                Finally, for the third pun, I used low aperature and high shutter speed to capture a drop of water falling into a bucket.

                For my second Mini Photo Challenge, I decided to choose the theme "product," attempting to "sell" a product using photography.
                I decided to photograph my watch (Casio MQ24 Series), a set of prisms, and some shoes.
                For the first photo, I took a photo of my watch against black plastic background, using my computer screen to reflect a fake bokoeh behind the watch.
                And for the edit, I cropped the image for a central focus and slightly tweaked the exposure and contrast.
                For the second edit, I used low aperature to focus on the prism itself, decreasing the temperature slightly in post to bring out the blue color.

                I decided to photograph several quotes, including "The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision," "Life could be a dream," and "Darkness cannot drive out darkness- only light can do that."
                For the first edit, I took a photo of a flashlight through a tube, using low aperature to focus detail on the edges of the tube.
                After adjusting some basic exposure and viginette, I used PhotoShop to "wrap" the quote around the edge of the tube.
                For the second edit, I took a photo of the sky, using 3 exposure brackets to capture the full dynamic range of the sky.

                For my fourth Mini Photo Challenge, I decided to choose the theme "crystalline," capturing photos of crystals and other crystal-like things.
                I decided to photograph several things, including a plastic crystal tree, a glass gem-like ball, a glass dice from a classmate, a crystal of amythest, and a rock of (I think) pyrite.
                For the first edit, I used blue and green light to illuminate the tree, which, interestingly enough, turned into blue and yellow light by maximizing the tint slider to +150. I focused the details of the tree using low aperature with a macro lens.
                For the second edit, I used a CD to refract rainbows along the amythest crystal, using a macro lens with high aperature to capture how the amythest reflected the light.
                I also turned up the tint significantly to emphasize the purple color of the amythest throughout the majority of the photo.
