                For my first Mini Photo Challenge, I decided to choose the theme "pun," literally showing a pun in action.
                I decided to photograph the puns "we don't see eye to eye," "I can't focus," and "a drop in the bucket."
                For the first pun, I took a photo of myself looking at and away from a mirror, then cropped them together in Photoshop for the final edit.
                For the second pun, I intentionally took off my lens to get an extreme close-up and low focus effect.
                Finally, for the third pun, I used low aperature and high shutter speed to capture a drop of water falling into a bucket.

                For my second Mini Photo Challenge, I decided to choose the theme "product," attempting to "sell" a product using photography.
                I decided to photograph my watch (Casio MQ24 Series), a set of prisms, and some shoes.
                For the first photo, I took a photo of my watch against black plastic background, using my computer screen to reflect a fake bokoeh behind the watch.
                And for the edit, I cropped the image for a central focus and slightly tweaked the exposure and contrast.
                For the second edit, I used low aperature to focus on the prism itself, decreasing the temperature slightly in post to bring out the blue color.
