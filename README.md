Github repository for my site. Currently hosted with GitHub Sites (to change soontm)

Built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## The Awperator
I don't include the full build of the game in the files since I find it redundant.

If you want the game included in the website, you can find the files [here](https://github.com/Primqd/WANICGD_Space_Chen). Build it with WebGL and save the full build to src/assets/operator_game.
